A classic Snake Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
The game uses grid-based rendering, event-driven input handling, and dynamic speed scaling to provide a smooth and challenging gameplay experience. <br>

Move the snake around the board, eat food to grow longer, and try to beat your high score! <br>
